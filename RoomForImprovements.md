# Room forimprovements

As with anything worldly, there is a chance to improve.

## Test-ability

> I haven't written tests for this solution, mainly because of the consumption of time. The utils are broken into pieces and are easily unit testable. I can think of API tests and E2E tests to be the part of the solution to raise confidence while deploying this.

## Containerization

> At the moment it is containerize, but environments could become the part of it to be applicable for production as well as development.

## Documentation

> I can think of generating JSDoc for files and classes involved, infact Database Schema for easily understanding the solution. I can also flourish a living document like docsify within the code base, that can help with updates of the docu space with each release.

## Code Standards

> At the moment my goal was to get all the functionalities in place, hence not much effort has been put to code practices but there is a huge room to change it.
